# CognitiveStack AI  
### Adaptive AI Learning Engine for Developer Productivity

---

## 🚀 Overview

CognitiveStack AI is an adaptive, goal-driven learning engine designed to accelerate developer productivity.

Instead of delivering static courses or generic AI answers, the system:

- Converts real-world developer goals into structured skill graphs
- Generates micro-learning exercises using AI
- Validates AI outputs deterministically
- Tracks mastery at the concept level
- Dynamically adapts difficulty
- Optimizes time-to-understanding

This system focuses on mastery, not content consumption.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Developers today:

- Consume fragmented documentation
- Rely on AI for quick answers
- Lack structured learning progression
- Cannot measure skill mastery
- Waste time on inefficient learning loops

Existing solutions are either:
- Static courses
- Chatbots
- Documentation platforms

None provide adaptive, goal-based learning optimization.
